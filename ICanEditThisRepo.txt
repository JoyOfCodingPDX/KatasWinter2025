Let's try an experiment this term.

In order to make sure that everyone in the class has the ability to edit this GitHub
repository, please find your initials below, edit the file to replace them with the
word "HERE", and the commit/push your change to GitHub.

You will likely need to do a "git pull" before you "git push" in order to get the
latest changes.  In fact, you may need to do this several times.

If you are not able to push to this repository, please DM your GitHub user id
(mine is "DavidWhitlock") to Dave in Slack.
